Release managers can review releases by inspecting the software development timeline. 

Visualizing releases data on a timeline enables managers to observe the intervals between releases and to perceive the time elapsed from the start of development to the delivery of the release. This information might enable a better plan of future releases.

Also, aggregating release churn and rework to the timeline can enable managers to discern the amount of work done and the amount of effort wasted during release development. It can lead to insights about why a given release was faster than others.

Further, inspecting a specific release may show information about the developer team. Releases can be a result of the collaboration of many developers, but can also be a result of a lone developer. Also, the main part of the release can be developed by a small group of developers. Understanding these effects of collaboration may enable the formation of better teams. 

Finally, other metrics, such as release length, release speed and the number of merges can help people to understand other aspects of the releases.
